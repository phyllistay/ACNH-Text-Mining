# ACNH-Text-Mining
R script to analyse Animal Crossing user reviews

## Background
Was obsessed with animal crossing during the lockdown, so I did some analysis on this data from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/animal-crossing


I cover the following in my analysis:
- How has the scoring/grading changed over time
- What the most common scores/grades are
- What are reviewers talking about

Here's a Tableau Dashboard on the findings :)
